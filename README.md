# Graphical interface of a piston
Through this program written in C using the library [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) you will be able to move a piston to compress a perfect gas, heat it with a flame and put it in a thermic bath to mantain costant its temperature.<br />
In this way you will be able to visualize the transformations to which a perfect gas can be subjected.<br />
When a perfect gas is compressed or heated, its macroscopic characteristics (pressure, volume and temperature) change. The equation that describes this changes is the following: **pV = nRT** (*with R = 8.31 J/(mol)K*).
